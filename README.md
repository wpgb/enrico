Eniro is one of the largest search companies in the Nordic region- and their public API ("Company search - basic") provides
information about companies in Sweden (eniro.se), Denmark (krak.dk), and Norway (gulesider.no)

This Wordpress plugin is utilising Eniro's public API to build and maintain your own directory of companies with both 
contact information and geo-data (location) supplied by Eniro. The data received from Eniro can be supplemented with your own
information fields and categorization to customize your own company directory.

This greatly reuces the effort needed for registering companies, geocoding their locations and keeping the information up to date.

Basic templates to browse and present your company directory is included, with the
company locations displayed on a map (Eniromap or Googlemap depending on the preferred choice).

Eniro api key and profile is needed to make all this magic work!
